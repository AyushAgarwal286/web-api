### Spotify's Web API

#### Bugs or feature requests
The purpose of this repository is to work as the public issue tracker for [Spotify's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api). If you've found a bug in the API, or have ideas on how we could improve it, please [create an issue](https://www.github.com/spotify/web-api/issues). It's greatly appreciated.

[Open bug tickets](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/labels/bug) | [Open feature requests](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/labels/enhancement) | [All](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues) 

**If you want to show your support for an existing feature request, please add a [thumbs up reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead of commenting  "_+1_".** This way the creator of the feature request doesn't get spammed by Github.

For bugs and features related to the mobile SDKs, please visit the repositories for the [Android SDK](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/) or the [iOS SDK](https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk/).

If you have ideas, bug reports, or any other type of feedback to Spotify that doesn't relate to the Web API, please submit these at [Spotify's Community forums](https://community.spotify.com/).

#### API Specification (RAML)

The repository also contains the [RAMLâ„¢ specification](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/tree/master/specifications/raml) for the Spotify Web API. [RAML](http://raml.org/index.html) is a YAML-based language that describes RESTful APIs and provides all the information necessary to describe RESTful APIs, create API client-code and API server-code generators, and create API user documentation from RAML API definitions.

#### Other support

We refer to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spotify) for programming related issues. Remember to add the `spotify` tag to your question.
